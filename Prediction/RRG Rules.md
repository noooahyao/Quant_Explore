# Business Rules

**Relative strength**: You could set a rule to buy ETFs that are in the leading quadrant and sell ETFs that are in the lagging quadrant.

**Momentum**: You could set a rule to buy ETFs that are moving from the improving quadrant to the leading quadrant and sell ETFs that are moving from the weakening quadrant to the lagging quadrant.

**Diversification**: For example, you could set a rule to buy one ETF from each quadrant to ensure exposure to different sectors.

**Risk management**: You could set a rule to sell ETFs that move from the leading quadrant to the weakening or lagging quadrant, as this could indicate a loss of momentum or a shift in market conditions

**Buy strong candidates in leading quadrant**: Identify assets that are in the leading quadrant and have strong momentum, then buy these assets as they are expected to outperform the market in the short term.

**Sell weak candidates in lagging quadrant**: Identify assets that are in the lagging quadrant and have weak momentum, then sell these assets as they are expected to underperform the market in the short term.

**Buy assets moving from weakening to leading quadrant**: Identify assets that are transitioning from the weakening quadrant to the leading quadrant, then buy these assets as they have the potential to gain momentum and outperform the market in the near future.

**Buy assets moving from lagging to improving quadrant**: Identify assets that are transitioning from the lagging quadrant to the improving quadrant, then buy these assets as they are expected to improve and potentially outperform the market in the medium to long term.

**Take profits on assets moving from leading to weakening quadrant**: Identify assets that are transitioning from the leading quadrant to the weakening quadrant, then take profits on these assets as they are likely to experience a decrease in momentum and underperform the market in the near future.

**Use stop losses**: Set stop loss orders to limit potential losses in case the market moves against the expected trend
